    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Data-driven problem solver with a robust foundation in data science and computer science, actively seeking opportunities to leverage analytical skills and technical expertise. 
      My academic journey towards a B.S. in Data Science at San Jose State University has equipped me with hands-on proficiency in Python, C++, and Java, complemented by practical experience in managing large datasets and developing effective algorithms. 
      Beyond the technical realm, my dedication extends to the badminton court, where strategic thinking, precise execution, and a collaborative spirit are paramount â€“ qualities I bring to every analytical challenge. 
      I am eager to contribute to innovative projects, translating complex data into actionable insights within a collaborative team environment.</p>

      <h3>Hospital Management Database</h3>
      <p>The project being presented is a system built using Java and SQL which will include hospital operations. 
         The purpose of this project is to improve hospital efficiency, reduce paper waste, and allow for real-time access to patient and hospital data for authorized medical staff. 
         It is relevant because hospitals, through the use of this system, will have more resources to provide faster, more accurate services while improving the overall patient experience.

      <h3>UBX World</h3>
      <p>
        I leveraged Python to process and analyze multi-gigabyte datasets from various sports tournaments, playing a key role in developing a more accurate, data-driven player rating system. 
        To enhance the analysis, I implemented a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)-based adjacency matrix that visualized and quantified player overlap across tournaments. 
        This enabled effective network analysis of player participation patterns, providing deeper insights into competitive dynamics and tournament structure.
